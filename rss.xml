But no product exists in a vacuum. After years of buildup, we're now faced with two competitive, PC-tethered VR headsets hitting the market right next to each other.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a473611978ca4931a0d74678d9cd4a6eaafdb8a9.jpg"></article>]]></description>
